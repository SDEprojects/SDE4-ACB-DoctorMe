# DR ME RPG
ORIGINAL CODE - 
* This is a simple RPG created mostly for the purpose of conducting training in AGILE
* More features may or may not be forth coming.
* This game was intended to also be the start of a training game, to educate the player along the way.

REFACTORED CODE - 
<h4> Tech used: Java, JUnit4, XML, GitHub, Azure Board, Agile and SCRUM methodologies, MS Teams, IntelliJ
<h4> Goal: RPG Game in Java with a GUI and use of XML to store data, team of three practicing Agile
</h4>
* Quiz Game with extensibility to multiple levels, by simply swapping XML files for Game Text, Locations, Questions
* 12 Locations, 5 Questions per Location
* User can answer the question or change locations
* Locations and Questions, paired by 'Type' which in the first level equals Topic
* Answer 3 questions correctly per location to earn a badge
* Earn all 12 badges to 'level up' - more levels under development 

--> Further potential: 
* it is fun and there is lots of potential for expansion or use as a personal study aid - edutainment is 'in'
* the question xml can be followed to create load alternate questions, if only a question based study aid was wanted
